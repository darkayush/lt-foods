                            retained its leadership in the basmati

                            convenience-led offerings. In the UK
                            and Europe, the rollout of Gold Seal
                            Indus Valley as a value brand is helping
                            us tap into price-sensitive consumer
                            groups while expanding into private label
                            segments. Heritage®, a trusted brand in
                            our portfolio, continues to hold a strong
                            presence in select international markets,

                            retail channels, where it is positioned as
                            a high-quality, affordable basmati option
                            for everyday consumption.
