                    Stakeholder engagement is integral to our strategy and our
                    commitment to responsible, future-focused business practices. Guided
                    by the principles of inclusivity, transparency and responsiveness, our

                    By listening to and addressing the expectations of those who influence or are impacted by our
                    operations, we aim to create enduring value and build shared success across our ecosystem.
                    This philosophy aligns with the broader framework of stakeholder capitalism and is built
                    around four interlinked principles.

                        Our ability to create and sustain value is closely linked to how effectively we engage with stakeholders across our value
                        chain. We recognise that each stakeholder group has distinct expectations, priorities and areas of interest, and we
                        aim to address these through transparent communication, regular engagement and meaningful collaboration. Our
                        engagement framework ensures that we listen to their perspectives, respond to their needs and align our business
                        strategies with shared objectives.
