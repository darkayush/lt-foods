                        We partner with authorised
                        third-party recyclers and support
                        Extended Producer Responsibility
                        (EPR) frameworks by funding the
                        collection and recycling of equivalent
                        volumes of plastic dispatched. Our
                        secondary packaging already uses
                        recycled paper, and we continue to
                        innovate in primary formats to ensure
                        sustainability without compromising
                        food safety or shelf appeal.

                        Sustainable sourcing is a foundational
                        principle for us. We are a founding
                        member of the Sustainable Rice
                        Platform (SRP) and all our facilities
                        follow SRP Chain of Custody (CoC)
                        protocols, assuring traceable, low-
                        impact rice sourcing.

                        We have trained farmers in
                        collaboration with ICAR-NCIPM to
                        adopt water-saving techniques such
                        as Alternate Wetting and Drying
                        (AWD), laser levelling and integrated
                        pest management. Our field officers
                        conduct weekly visits to record
                        field activities data, advise on best
                        practices and carry out internal
                        and external audits to maintain
                        compliance.

                        Through Nature Bio Foods, our
                        subsidiary, we empower farming
                        communities with access to
                        technology, soil-health tracking tools
                        and solar-powered irrigation systems.
                        These efforts are not only improving
                        yield and reducing environmental
                        impact but also elevating rural
                        livelihoods and food security.
