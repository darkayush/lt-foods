                            The 'King of Basmati' title, global reach, celebrated the values of hospitality
                            and perfection, mirroring the meticulousness and pride that DAAWAT brings

                    We continued to celebrate India's rich cultural mosaic through campaigns
                    that connected deeply with regional traditions. In Kolkata, we created a

                    Kalighat Bose Lane, capturing the spirit of Durga Puja. During Navaratri,

                    We also launched a high-impact campaign during Ramadan in India,
                    featuring Shah Rukh Khan. The campaign resonated deeply with
                    audiences by capturing the essence of togetherness and sustenance
                    during the festive season. It received an overwhelming response across
                    markets. Under the brand 'Heritage', we organised campaigns celebrating the
                    harvest season with special packs and retail promotions across South India,
                    while the Goa Carnival was marked with festive brands and experiences
                    in one of the world's finest train with global appeal. Together, these

                            pioneering initiative aimed at
                            bridging knowledge between
                            Indian farmers, scientists and
                            global experts. The programme

                            from Madhya Pradesh and
                            Haryana, along with leading
                            scientists, providing them with
                            an opportunity to engage
                            with advanced agricultural
