                    shared value for all stakeholders. To this end, we undertake structured
                    materiality assessments to identify and prioritise the environmental,
                    economic and social issues most critical to our operations and ecosystem.

                    As we move forward, we are working to redefine our ESG boundaries specifically for our India
                    operations while revisiting our ESG Materiality Matrix and aligning our targets accordingly.
                    These steps will also support our goal of further strengthening ESG reporting, ensuring that our
                    disclosures remain relevant and reflective of our evolving sustainability ambition
