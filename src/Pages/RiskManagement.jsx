                    Effective risk management is embedded in our
                    operating philosophy, enabling prudent decisionmaking, reinforcing business continuity and supporting
                    the long-term value creation for stakeholders.

                    Our approach is structured, forwardlooking and integrated across all
                    levels of the organisation. We aim to
                    not only mitigate potential threats
                    but also to identify opportunities
                    that may emerge from shifting
                    market dynamics. By incorporating
                    risk management into our strategy
                    and governance, we remain agile
                    and better equipped to protect
                    stakeholder interests.

                    We maintain a comprehensive
                    framework that assesses both
                    internal and external risks, ranging
                    from operational and supply chain
                    challenges to financial, regulatory,
                    geopolitical and reputational
                    exposures. This enables us to
                    respond swiftly and adaptively, while
                    staying aligned with our long-term
                    objectives.

                    responsibly, resources are
