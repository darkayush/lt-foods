                            Bahalgarh plant, production capacity was
                            enhanced through targeted upgrades,

                            Packaging capacity scaled up from 23,000
                            tons to 3,75,000 tons, with enhanced

                            oilseeds and nuts sourced from over 20
                            countries. With this expansion, NBF targets
