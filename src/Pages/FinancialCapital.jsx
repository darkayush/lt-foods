                    We adopt a disciplined and forward-looking financial
                    strategy designed aimed at delivering sustained growth
                    while maintaining a resilient balance sheet. Our capital
                    deployment is guided by long-term value creation, return
                    optimisation and risk-calibrated expansion. In FY 2025, we
                    continued to strengthen our financial position by scaling
                    up high-potential segments, investing in brand equity and
                    digital transformation as well as expanding our global
                    footprint across both core and emerging markets.

                <p className='text-xl font-light mt-4'>
                    We focused on a multi-lever approach, encompassing
                    growth through brand investment, strategic acquisitions,
                    operational optimisation and digital initiatives. These
                    efforts are all underpinned with strategic objectives,
                    distribution expansion, margin expansion and optimising

                            In FY 2025, we achieved consolidated
                            revenue (including other income)
                            of ₹8,770 Crore, reflecting a yearon-year growth of 12%. This growth
                            was broad-based, led by strong
                            consumer demand, expanded
                            distribution and targeted brand
                            investments across key geographies.
                            North America remained our highest
                            growth contributor, posting a 18%
                            increase backed by continued traction
                            of our brands. In India, revenue
                            increased by 9% as we deepened our
                            omnichannel presence across general
                            trade, modern trade, e-commerce/

                            Gross profit margin improved from
                            32.5% in FY 2024 to 34.5% in FY 2025.
                            This improvement was supported
                            by softening input prices, enhanced
                            procurement efficiency and stronger
                            sourcing analytics. EBITDA stood
                            at ₹1,067 Crore, translating to an
                            EBITDA margin of 12.2%, marginally
                            lower than the 12.6% recorded in
                            the previous year. The decline was
                            mainly due to higher freight costs
                            and increased brand investments in
                            India and international markets to
                            strengthen long-term equity.

                            Profitability levers during the
                            year included a sharper focus on
                            high-margin product categories,
                            discontinuation of lower-profit lines,
                            stronger supply chain optimisation
                            and operational efficiency measures
                            that helped mitigate inflationary
                            pressures in freight and logistics.
                            While logistics cost increased by
                            ~1.7% compared to the prior year,
                            disciplined cost management and
                            procurement savings offset much of
                            the impact, enabling us to expand
                            gross margins by ~200 basis points.
